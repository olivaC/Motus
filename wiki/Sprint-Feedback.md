### Sprint 3 [90/100]

Good work so far, looking very nice. 


For the final sprint we would really like to see:

-  [ ] diary timeline for parent linked to child activity (link childs video to it)
-  [ ] calendar (http://nobrok.com/appointment-booking-app-using-react-native-part-1/)
-  [ ] more testing (although the features above should be implemented first)
