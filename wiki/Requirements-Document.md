# Project Description 

Motus aims to fill in the gap in the market for a tool allowing streamlined and easy communication among health care professionals and their patients to enhance therapy sessions. It acts as a platform to allow health care professionals to monitor their patients' progress as well as to give patients educational tools to take home. An administrator of the application can create these lessons using a lightweight content management system to create lessons containing fun, interactive and educational videos for children, as well as upload educational material for parents. Mental health professionals use a mobile application assign and track child progression through these lessons and can provide material for a parent to help with their emotional intelligence. A parent using the application can view educational material, as well as to view their child's progress. Children using the application can interactively view the videos and provide a reaction to gauge their emotions. The mobile application will be developed on both iOS and Android platforms to be as accessible as possible.
